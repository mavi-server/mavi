Create an abstracted and extendible server without coding!

This module aims to lift repetitive works that you have made every time building a server from scratch.

## What Mavi offers?

1. Create an advanced REST API and relational database with one json file
1. Create relations between models and get data with deep level objects (`populated`) from API
1. Have essential queries for each route you defined (`sort`,`limit`,`where`,`exclude`), control/secure them!
1. Define dynamic queries for deep data levels (populated data)
1. Define static routes and serve static files (like `html pages` or `server uploads`)
1. Controllers: `find, findOne, count, delete, update, create, upload, login, logout , register`
1. Middlewares: `authorization, is-owner`
1. Utils: `detect language` -- will be added more
1. You can create your own controllers/middlewares/utils too!

These were the fundamentals. There are more features to mention!
